# The dashboard is sent by email. Some operating systems or email applications, such as iOS and Apple Mail, 
# start a preview client for attachments. In such preview clients, the graphs may not work properly, 
# since the JavaScript is not interpreted there. 
#
# If you want to open and view the dashboard directly from Apple Mail on iOS (without downloading it first), 
# you can either view it without graphs or enable a WebDAV server on the NAS. 
#
# The link sent in the report email then has the following structure: http://NAS_IP:WEBDAV_PORT/NAS_SHARE/latest-dashboard.html 
# The dashboard is always saved in the PI’s home directory ($HOME_PI/latest-dashboard.html).
# Under the section “Backup Sources” (backup.conf), you should also specify the dashboard as a file to be backed up 
# so that it is stored on the NAS.
# Example: "/home/your_pi_user/bmsu_dashboard.html"

# Port for WebDAV on the NAS
# If no WebDAV server is active on the NAS, delete the port here. Example:
WEBDAV_PORT="5001" # change this to the WebDAV port configured on your nas
